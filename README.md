# Statistical Data Analysis 2

This is the official repository containing Lab materials for Statistical Data Analysis 2 (SAD2) course. 

Expect lab materials in `.ipynb` format to appear before the class begins and solutions for the materials before the start of the next lab, a week later. 

We will also post here additional materials mentioned during lab meetings.
