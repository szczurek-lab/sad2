# Statistical Data Analysis 2

This is the official repository containing Lab materials for Statistical Data Analysis 2 (SAD2) course. 

Expect lab materials in `.ipynb` format to appear before the class begins and solutions for the materials before the start of the next lab, a week later. 

We will also post here additional materials mentioned during lab meetings. 

We encourage you to connect, collaborate and work together on Lab materials or lectures on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DYE7YZUN).

## Topics

- Lab 1: Frequentist vs Bayesian: Intro to torch.distributions + Likelihoods
- Lab 2: TBA: Intro to Pyro
